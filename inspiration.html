    <p style="font-size: 30px">I dreamed of becoming an astronaut as a child, to explore the unknown and see the world from a new perspective. Now that I’m older, even if I never set foot in space, I’ve found another way to explore: through art, music, and multimedia creation. In my own way, I still reach for the stars by designing, imagining, and building projects that inspire curiosity and wonder.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">Over the years, I’ve discovered that creativity can be its own form of exploration. Every brushstroke, every melody, and every animation is like charting a new constellation. A journey into ideas that have never existed before. My work in Entertainment and Multimedia Computing allows me to merge technology with imagination, turning concepts into experiences that others can see, hear, and feel. It’s not about escaping reality, but about expanding it, giving people new ways to connect and dream.</p>
